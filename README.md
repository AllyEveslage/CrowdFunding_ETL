# Crowdfunding ETL Project

# Overview
This project focuses on building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform data. After transforming the data, we created four CSV files, which were used to design an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a table schema. Finally, the transformed data was uploaded into Postgres database. The purpose of this database is to create crowdfunding campaign data, including information on categories, subcategories, campaigns, and contacts.
