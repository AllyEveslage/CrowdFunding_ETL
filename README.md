# Project-2-Group-2: Crowdfunding ETL Project

# Overview
This project focuses on building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform data. After transforming the data, we created four CSV files, which were used to design an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a table schema. Finally, the transformed data was uploaded into Postgres database. The purpose of this database is to create crowdfunding campaign data, including information on categories, subcategories, campaigns, and contacts. 

# Files
crowdfunding.xlsx: The raw data for crowdfunding campaigns
contacts.xlsx: The raw data for contact info
category.csv: The CSV file with the category data
subcategory.csv: The CSV file with subcategory data
campaign.csv: The CSV file with campaign details 
contacts.csv: The CSV file with campaign details 
crowdfunding_db_schema.sql: The SQL schema to create the tables in the Postgres database
